Welcome to my personal website. I don't intend on sharing much here; just contact information and maybe some relevant work history.

Right now my interests are security or bitcoin or privacy oriented. I'm focusing heavily on developing [Bitcoin Cache Machine](https://github.com/BitcoinCacheMachine/BitcoinCacheMachine) over on Github. Read more about Bitcoin Cache Machine at the [public site](https://www.bitcoincachemachine.org). If you want to coordinate and help with BCM, consider joining the [BitcoinCacheMachine Keybase Team Site](https://keybase.io/team/btccachemachine).
