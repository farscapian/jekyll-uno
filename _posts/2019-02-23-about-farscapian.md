Welcome to my personal website. I don't intend on sharing much here; just contact information and maybe some relevant work history.

Right now my interests are in containers, security, bitcoin, and privacy. I'm focusing heavily on developing <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinCacheMachine/BitcoinCacheMachine" target="_blank">Bitcoin Cache Machine</a> over on Github. Read more about Bitcoin Cache Machine at the <a href="https://www.bitcoincachemachine.org" target="_blank">public site</a>. If you want to coordinate and help with BCM, consider joining the <a href="https://keybase.io/team/btccachemachine" target="_blank">Bitcoin Cache Machine Team Site</a>.

I really like coffee which is why I chose the coffee background.
