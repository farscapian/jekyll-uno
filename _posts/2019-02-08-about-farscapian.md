Welcome to my personal website.

These are usually security or bitcoin or privacy oriented. Right now with Docker Swarm (>=v3.2 `docker stack`) style commands. I’ve gotten heavy into Docker and Docker Swarm, LXD, and other ways to software-define everything. I’ve been playing around with LXD system containers, MACVLAN, VXLAN, etc.

Contact: I am farscapian on Twitter, Keybase, and github.
